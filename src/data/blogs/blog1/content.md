# Introduction

This post is about the long, sometimes uncertain, but deeply rewarding journey I took while applying to graduate programs abroad. As a computer engineering student from Turkey, I always knew I wanted to continue my studies with a master's, possibly even a PhD. But I had no idea how many lessons, reflections, and personal growth moments would come along the way.

# Where It All Started

The idea of studying in the United States for my master's wasn't something that came to me late in university, it actually started way earlier. Back in middle school, I remember thinking that I would do my bachelor's in Turkey and then, if everything aligned, go to the U.S. for my graduate studies. It wasn't just a passing thought, it slowly turned into a quiet goal I kept in the back of my mind.

Years later, I began my undergraduate studies at TOBB University of Economics and Technology, where I spent two terms. I later decided to transfer to Yıldız Technical University, looking for a better fit for my academic and personal growth. Around that time, during my first years of university, AI was beginning to accelerate rapidly, and the whole field of machine learning and language models was evolving at breakneck speed. Seeing this shift up close didn't just excite me, it strengthened the goal I had carried for years and made it feel even more timely and aligned with where the world was heading.

# Researching Universities

I started researching universities in July, months before any applications were due, and more than a year before I'd actually begin a graduate degree. Even though my main goal had always been to do my master's in the U.S., I didn't start out with tunnel vision. I also looked into schools in Europe and the UK, weighing all the possibilities. But the more I explored, the more I felt drawn back to my original plan. There was something about the U.S. that aligned better with what I was aiming for, both in terms of research opportunities and long-term goals, so I decided to focus my efforts there.

To get a broad view, I used sites like [Times Higher Education (THE)](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/) and [QS Rankings](https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings) to compare universities on a global scale. These helped me understand where institutions stood internationally, but eventually, I narrowed the scope. I shifted to a U.S.-only perspective and began using the [U.S. News Computer Science Graduate Rankings](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/computer-science-rankings?_sort=rank-asc), which allowed me to dig deeper into each program individually. That's when things got serious.

I built a detailed Google Sheets document to organize everything, tuition costs, program strengths, funding opportunities, graduate outcomes, faculty, locations, you name it. My father helped me a lot on this; he worked day and night to help me complete the sheet, and his support made a big difference during this overwhelming phase. This list included more than 150 universities, which gave me a broad perspective before I narrowed it down to a final group of over ten schools to apply to. Some of these were ambitious choices, schools that might have been a stretch, but I also made sure to include safer options to balance things out.

Around that time, a friend suggested I also consider PhD programs. He pointed out that some companies, especially those focused on research and innovation, often prefer hiring PhD graduates. That advice made me rethink the boundaries I had set for myself. So I decided to explore that route, too.

# Reaching Out to Professors (PhD)

After narrowing down my list of universities, I made another comprehensive Google Sheets document, this time focused on the professors I wanted to work with across all those schools. The sheet had a lot of details: each professor's research areas, links to their labs and personal websites, and notes I took from reading their papers and profiles. By the time I finished, my list included almost 300 professors.

From those, I sent emails to 43 professors and got responses from 9. If you're new to this process, that's actually a solid response rate. One tip I'd share: send your emails in mid to late summer. This is when many professors have fewer classes and exams to handle, so they're less busy and more likely to reply. It's also when available positions in their labs become clearer.

Another important piece of advice is to carefully follow any instructions on the professor's website about contacting them. Many professors ask you to include specific information in your email, even secret codes or phrases, to show you've done your homework. I wrote a personalized email for each professor, mentioning their papers and explaining how their work connects to my own research experience.

A few professors even invited me for online meetings to discuss their work and my background. Interviewing is a big topic on its own, so I might write a separate blog post about that later.

# Preparing Documents and Applications

This was one of the hardest parts of the whole process. To complete your applications, you have to gather all your documents before the deadlines, so if you start late, things can get pretty stressful. Luckily, I started collecting my documents early, but I still faced a lot of challenges along the way.

First, most universities require an English language exam result if you're an international student. Many accept tests like TOEFL, IELTS, or Duolingo, but I chose to take the TOEFL. I took the exam back in February, and my score met the requirements, so I didn't need to retake it. I recommend doing this early yourself, if your score isn't high enough, you'll still have time to retake the exam. Keep in mind that TOEFL scores are only valid for two years.

Another exam that some (though not all) universities require is the GRE. I hadn't taken the GRE before, so I had limited time to study for it. Fortunately, I managed to get the scores I needed.

The most overwhelming part was getting letters of recommendation. I had already gone through this process when applying for scholarships, which helped me become familiar with how it works. I had to decide which professors to ask for letters. I got one from Prof. Banu Diri, with whom I worked on an undergraduate research project; one from Prof. Mehmet Fatih Amasyalı, whose lab I was part of; and the last one from Prof. Mehmet Sıddık Aktaş, who earned his MSc and PhD in the U.S. and helped me a lot throughout this process.

Getting the letters wasn't too hard because I already had good relationships with these professors. But the repeated requests to fill out recommendation forms for every university were a bit embarrassing. For those unfamiliar with the process, you do not upload the letters yourself; instead, you have to enter the professors' emails into each university's system, and the system emails them to upload the letter. Doing this for so many schools can feel awkward to ask over and over again. Thankfully, my professors were kind and never hesitated to help.

Once the letters were set, I had to write a statement of purpose (SoP) for each university. That's a detailed topic on its own, but you can find plenty of advice online or on university websites.

You also need your transcript(s) and CV to complete the application.

Finally, after gathering everything, all you have to do is submit your documents through the application systems.

One thing to keep in mind: taking and sending exam scores like TOEFL and GRE, plus application fees, adds up to a significant cost. But hopefully, all the effort and expense pay off in the end.

# Good News and Bad News

Waiting for decisions was brutal. After months of hard work, all you can do is wait, and refresh your inbox, and second-guess everything. I kept myself busy with classes, research, and small personal projects, but the uncertainty was always there.

While I was still applying to other universities, I got accepted to Syracuse University's MSc in Computer Science program with a 40% scholarship. That acceptance gave me a much-needed boost. It made me realize I was worthy of being accepted. Since Syracuse was the first university to say yes, it holds a special place for me.

Soon after, I got accepted to Arizona State University's MSc in Computer Science program. ASU was one of the highest-ranked schools on my list, so that news really excited me.

After these two admissions, I didn't hear back from other universities for a while. Then, months later, I finally got an email from the University of Southern California. USC was near the top of my list, just after UC Berkeley and the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW Madison), two schools I honestly didn't expect to hear from. That acceptance changed everything.

But then the rejections started to come. I was rejected by UC Berkeley, UW Madison (for MSc CS), and Clemson University and Virginia Tech (for PhD CS). Those were heartbreaking, especially because I had hoped for some of them.

On the bright side, I was accepted to several others, including the University of Illinois Chicago and University of Oklahoma for MSc CS, and Louisiana State University (LSU) and University at Albany–SUNY for PhD CS.

Now, with all these decisions on the table, it was time for me to make a choice…

# Making a Decision

This was without a doubt the hardest part. I had multiple admissions and had to decide before the deadlines. After days of narrowing things down, I reduced my options to three: ASU MSc, USC MSc, and LSU PhD.

Both master's programs offered great academic environments. Their tuition fees were similar, but USC was noticeably more expensive. USC also had a clear advantage in location, Los Angeles offers far better job opportunities in computer science compared to ASU's Tempe.

The LSU PhD was a completely different path. Cost wasn't an issue since it was fully funded, but it required a much higher level of commitment. I went through several rounds of interviews with the professor at LSU, who was very understanding no matter what decision I made.

After gathering advice from many people, I ultimately decided to go with USC. What shaped my choice most were the location, right in the heart of California's tech scene and close to Silicon Valley, the faculty's research areas that aligned with my own, and the prestige of the university. USC is ranked 21st in the field of computer science among all U.S. universities, which also gave me confidence in the program’s quality and reputation.

All this hard work and uncertainty came down to that one moment, making the decision.

# What's Next?

Now that this chapter is closing, I'm genuinely excited about what lies ahead. This journey has taught me a lot, not just about academia, but about persistence and about myself.

If you're reading this and thinking about applying to grad school, here's my advice: it's a marathon, not a sprint. It takes time, patience, and effort. But in the end, it's absolutely worth it.
